## Internships

Each year, we have a diverse cohort of students who are interested in applying their skills to real-world problems through external internships. Our students are particularly interested in work that lends itself to continuing research towards a final capstone thesis project. Our RSIV Masters students are well-qualified for a range of data-driven projects, and are capable of turning geographic and environmental data analyses into useful visualizations for broad audiences, including both researchers, policymakers, media, and the public.

Recent student projects have included flood mapping in remote regions, quantifying the biomass content of savanna landscapes, detecting changes in glacier lakes in the Himalaya, using UAV (aka drone) mapping for terrain generation and feature identification, Lidar point-cloud classification for vegetation analysis, and monitoring areas of unusually high methane emissions. A list of past MSc theses is available at [https://up-rs-esp.github.io/msc-rsiv/theses/](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/msc-rsiv/theses/), and a partial list of past internship topics can be found below.

If your organization is interested in working with motivated and capable students on an applied research project, please feel free to get in touch via  **[bodo.bookhagen@uni-potsdam.de](mailto:bodo.bookhagen@uni-potsdam.de)**. Each student can undertake up to two internships of ~180 hours each (3-4 weeks full time, or longer part-time). Further information on the program can be found here: [course list](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/msc-rsiv/curriculum/) and here: [UP Program Description](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/studium/what-to-study/master/masters-courses-from-a-to-z/remote-sensing)
