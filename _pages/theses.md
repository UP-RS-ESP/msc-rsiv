# Steps for finding a MSc thesis topic

**The candidate (and only the candidate) is responsible for finding a MSc thesis topic. A master's thesis is an international scientific or artistic work that is written for the completion of a master's program. It shows that the candidate can conduct independent scientific work, but under supervision.**

There are different ways to identify your thesis topic. Usually, you talk to a researcher or lecturer whos lecture you have enjoyed and were you have excelled. Some researcher offer thesis topics during their classes. Often, you start a thesis with a research internship.

To get an idea for thesis topics, we list some past topics below. Most of them have been developed over several weeks of discussion between thesis advisor and candidate or during a research internship. Additional thesis topics are shown [here](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/theses/).

We also have a loose list of topics that we like to work on - please contact the listed advisor for additional information.
