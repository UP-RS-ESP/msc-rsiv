# Curriculum

The MSc RSIV program consists of five core modules coupled with several optional topics and a final thesis project.

# Information for Current Students

## Steps for finding a MSc thesis topic

There are different ways to identify your thesis topic. Usually, you talk to a researcher or lecturer during or after a class you have enjoyed and where you have excelled. Some instructors offer thesis topics during their classes, especially as continuations of class final projects. It is also often possible to start a thesis with an introductory research internship -- either with an instructor at UP or externally at another research institution or company.

**It is important to emphasize that the candidate (and only the candidate) is responsible for finding a MSc thesis topic -- students must take responsibility for designing their own final thesis project.** A master's thesis is an international scientific or artistic work that is written for the completion of a master's program. It shows that the candidate can conduct independent scientific work, aided by supervision from one or more advisors. For more information on thesis requirements, please see the official UP information [here](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/studium/studying/organizing-your-exams/final-thesis).

To get an idea for thesis topics, we list some past topics [here](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/msc-rsiv/msctheses/). Most of them have been developed over several weeks of discussion between the thesis advisor(s) and the candidate or during a research internship. Additional past thesis in the [Earth Surface Processes Group](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/) are shown [here](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/theses/).

Researchers and instructors in the RSIV program also have a loose list of topics that we like to work on - please contact the listed advisor for additional information.

## Internship requirements

An internship can be used for credit points during your MSc degree. Each student can undertake up to two internships of ~180 hours each (3-4 weeks full time, or longer part-time). **An internship is not required to graduate from the RSIV program**, but can be helpful for advanced candidates to develop research towards a thesis project. 

Internships must be **pre-approved** before credits can be given -- not all internships qualify for credit points, and this should be confirmed **before** the internship. **MORE INFO HERE ABOUT APPROVAL?**
