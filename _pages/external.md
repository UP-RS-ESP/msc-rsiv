The Remote Sensing, geoInformation and Visualization (RSIV) program at the Universit√§t Potsdam is a four-semester Master of Science program geared towards training the next generation of earth scientists and remote-sensing specialists. The RSIV program trains students in quantitative data analysis, with a particular focus on applicable skills such as computer programming, machine learning, and the management and exploitation of large airborne- and satellite-data archives. Our RSIV Masters students are well-qualified for a range of data-driven projects, and are capable of turning geographic and environmental data analyses into useful visualizations for broad audiences. 

Each year, we have a diverse cohort of students who are interested in applying their skills to real-world problems through external internships. Our students are particularly interested in work that lends itself to continuing research towards a final capstone thesis project. Recent student projects have included flood mapping in remote regions, quantifying the biomass content of savanna landscapes, detecting changes in glacier lakes in the Himalaya, using UAV (aka drone) mapping for terrain generation and feature identification, Lidar point-cloud classification for vegetation analysis, and monitoring areas of unusually high methane emissions. A list of past MSc theses is available at [https://up-rs-esp.github.io/msc-rsiv/theses/](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/msc-rsiv/theses/). 

If your organization is interested in working with motivated and capable students on an applied research project, please feel free to get in touch via  **[bodo.bookhagen@uni-potsdam.de](mailto:bodo.bookhagen@uni-potsdam.de)**. Each student can undertake up to two internships of ~180 hours each (3-4 weeks full time, or longer part-time).
