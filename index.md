**MSc Remote Sensing, geoInformation, and Visualization**

The MSc RSIV was founded in 2016 at the Universität Potsdam with the goal of training the next generation of geo-data scientists. Students in our program are trained to use a wide range of remote sensing tools and techniques to answer pressing geo-scientific and environmental questions across the globe. As the volume and diversity of environmental data continues to increase exponentially, we maintain a strong focus on data-driven tools and techniques, particularly programming and statistical analysis.

Theoretical and practical coursework is coupled with optional research internships, as well as a final capstone thesis project. We maintain contacts with other research institutions, NGOs, and industry in and around Berlin, but are always open to new collaborations. If you would like more information on collaborative internship projects, please see [here]() – we also maintain a list of past [theses](https://up-rs-esp.github.io/msc-rsiv/theses/) and [internship projects]().
